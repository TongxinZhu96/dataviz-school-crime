##Description:
# Points/States above the reference line show a decrease in number of students who did this per 100,000 students enrolled in 2015-16 school year compared to 2009-10 school year while points/states below the line show an increase.
# The reletive increase and absolute values of number of U.S. public school students (12-18) who brought firearms to or possessed firearms at school per 100,000 students enrolled show a worse situation in the South and Midwest.
# Policies and lessons from Washington state (as well as states near original point) might be helpful for other states to improve safety issues.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
